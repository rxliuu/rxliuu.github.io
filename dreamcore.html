    <h3>Defination</h3>
    <p>Dreamcore is a surrealist aesthetic that uses motifs commonly associated with dreams, daydreams or nightmares, portrayed through media such as images, videos and, on occasion, music. Dreamcore focuses on emulating the general feeling of a dream and uses brighter color.
       Dreamcore’s exact origins are unknown, the direct origins might be tumblr user "jaaaaaim" way back in 2018. It mostly gained popularity in the early-mid 2020s with a surge of TikTok videos containing dreamlike visuals. The videos often include original characters that are typically drawn or stitched together with numerous images. These characters usually have objects for heads.

    <h3>Visual</h3>
    <p>Dreamcore, as stated before, is commonly portrayed through images and videos, which utilize different ‘base images’ such as liminal spaces, unrealistic terrain and structures (photoshopped hills, floating buildings, etc.), or even fantasy-like lands, to give the visual a dream-like quality. Dreamcore visuals are typically lighter-toned and pastel in colour, or more bright and vivid. These ‘base images’ are then overlaid with different elements, with the major ones being text and characters.
